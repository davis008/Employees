# Employees
Employees Code

In this project,the Employee Hierachy is implemented as class Emloyees

There is also the EmployeeTest class where the tests are written.

I have used two constuctors of the class Employee:
The first is for accepting each employee id,manager and salary
2.The second constructor is for validation.

Several tests are done to make sure that:
1.One emloyee reports to only one manager
2.That there is only one CEO
3.THere is no circular refference:-the first emloyee reporting to the second employee that is under the first employee.
5.Salaries are integers
6.There is no manager that is not an employee.

XUnit was used for testing in this project.i used it instead of NUnit because it is modern as perfoms better than the latter.
